# a Mediocre Dev

This is the landing page for amediocre.dev home of what will be developed into my personal portfolio website.

As a fun little exercise the website was written using **[Imba](https://imba.io/)**. A language invented by people from my hometown.

If you are a fellow developer looking for inspiration, please don't hesitate to yank some of the code, or contacting me if you have questions.

## Imba

> This project was bootstrapped with [imba-base-template](https://github.com/imba/imba-base-template).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`
