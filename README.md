# a Mediocre Dev

This is the landing page for amediocre.dev home of what will be developed into my personal portfolio website.

Having played around with **[Imba](https://imba.io/)** for a while I have come to realize it does not suit my needs yet. And as I am fleshing out my website I have landed on using **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)** instead

If you are a fellow developer looking for inspiration, please don't hesitate to yank some of the code, or contacting me if you have questions.

## Svelte(Kit)

Svelte has been around for a few years, and it has steadily gained popularity as it has grown more feature rich and stabilized. With SvelteKit having launched this year, and soon to reach version 1.0. The time for jumping onto the proverbial _"bandwagon"_ has never been more ripe.

SvelteKit has, unlike any other JS framework so far, amazed me with its DX, and I really hope to be using this framework a lot going forward.

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
